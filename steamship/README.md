Do you have a unique personality in mind for our AI model, GirlfriendGPT? Great! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add it.

## Step 1: Define Your Personality
First, you'll need to define your personality. This is done by creating a new Python file in the src/personalities directory.

For example, if your personality is named "jane", you would create a file called `jane.json`. Inside this file, you would define the characteristics and behaviors that embody "jane". This could include her speaking style, responses to certain inputs, or any other defining features you envision.

## Step 2: Test and Submit

Before you submit your new personality, please test it to ensure everything works as expected. If all is well, submit a Pull Request with your changes, and be sure to include the title "{name} - {description}" where {name} is your personality's name, and {description} is a brief explanation of the personality.

Good luck, and we can't wait to meet your new GirlfriendGPT personality!
